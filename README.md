*Jasonelle Team* maintains *Jasonette*, which is a framework that uses [JSON](https://www.json.org/) and _JavaScript_ as the main language to create *Android* and *iOS* applications.

## 📱 Jasonette

*Jasonette* is an amazing tool. It let you simplify the complex process of
building native mobile apps. With *Jasonette* you have the power of *JSON + Javascript*
at your hands. **Totally Native!**. No html or weird build tools needed. Just
good old *JSON*.
